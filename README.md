# Doppler-Radar-Signal-Processing
Master's Thesis Project - Design of an Interactive Learning Module for Doppler Radar Signal Processing .(Halmstad University, Sweden)
## Abstract 
This thesis project presents the design of an interactive learning module for Doppler radar signal processing. 
The work includes
- MATLAB simulations of Doppler radar signals   
- Real-time implementation of signal processing.  
- Use of radar sensor (Sense2GoL Pulse).
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and deliverables related to the Master’s thesis.  
 
## Repository Structure
- /matlab – MATLAB scripts for data extraction, frame storage, frame comparison, and speed estimation.  
- /deliverables/ – Deliverables such as plots and processed data.   

## Instructions
### MATLAB (R2024b)
1. Open the /matlab/ folder  
2. Run 'extract_raw_data.m' to load radar raw data  
3. Use 'framestorage.m' to Stores 10 radar frames and their corresponding signals for  analysis  
4. Run 'framecomparison.m' for I/Q signals and FFTs frame analysis and comparison  
5. Run 'Speed_Comparison.m' for Estimates and compare the  Doppler speed estimation
